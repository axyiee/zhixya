## Goals

Our goals are to implement a format simple to read and use, while providing access in both programatically and visually ways.
This table will be updated as we go evolving the library. Suggestions are welcome to add new features and improve existing ones.
* [ ] Find a really good way to structure the format itself
* [ ] Choose the right file format for the exported data (JSON, YAML, XML, RON, ...)
* [ ] Implement a good way to read and write the format
* [ ] Create a API for editing the data through I/O
* [ ] Find a good way to implement the editor
* [ ] Make the editor cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, ...)

## Installation

There is no way to install or add Zhixya to your project in a stable way currently.

## Credits

* Our primary inspiration for structuring the library came from the [Leafwing Studios's template repository][template].
